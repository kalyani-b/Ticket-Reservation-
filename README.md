# Ticket-Reservation-

 we have a flight schedule table, a customer table, and a booking table. For simplicity purpose, we suppose each flight can only have one customer. If a flight is occupied, then no other customer can access the same flight. If there is no exact matching flight (in terms of date, leave_from, going_to) or there is no available flight (state_sold = 1) for the customer, then no information will be inserted to the database. If all conditions match, we will insert the customer information into the customer table, update the flight state from 0 to 1, and insert the booking record in the booking table. All the above operations (1 Insert, 1 Update, 1 Insert) have to be committed successfully at the same time. Otherwise, if there is any error, the transaction has to be rolled back
